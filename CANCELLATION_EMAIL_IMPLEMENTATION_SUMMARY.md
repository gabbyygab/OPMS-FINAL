### **Pending Booking Cancellation Flow**:
1. Guest opens My Bookings page
2. Clicks on pending booking card
3. Clicks "Cancel Booking" button
4. Confirms cancellation in modal
5. `handleCancelBooking()` executes:
   - Deletes booking from Firestore
   - Updates local state
   - Sends cancellation email
   - Shows success toast
6. Guest receives confirmation email

### **Confirmed Booking Refund Flow**:
1. Guest opens My Bookings page
2. Clicks on confirmed booking (check-in date not passed)
3. Clicks "Request Refund" button
4. Confirms refund in modal
5. `handleRefund()` executes:
   - Updates guest wallet (adds refund)
   - Updates host wallet (deducts refund)
   - Creates transaction records
   - Removes booked dates from listing
   - Deletes booking from Firestore
   - Sends refund confirmation email
   - Shows success toast
6. Guest receives refund email with details

## üìä Refund Calculation in Email

For confirmed bookings requesting refunds:

```
Original Booking Amount:    ‚Ç±1,000.00
Service Fee (5%):           ‚Ç±   50.00
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
Refund Amount:              ‚Ç±1,050.00
(Credited to e-wallet)
```

**Note**: The refund includes the 5% service fee because the platform covers the service fee for cancelled bookings.

All email failures are handled gracefully:

1. **Primary service fails**: Logs error, tries fallback
2. **Fallback fails**: Logs error, continues without email
3. **UI Impact**: None - cancellation/refund completes successfully
4. **Logging**: All errors logged to browser console with emoji indicators:
   - ‚úÖ Success
   - ‚ùå Error
