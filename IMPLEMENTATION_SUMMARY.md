## Next Steps for Integration

### Required (Must Do):

1. **Add AuthModalProvider to App**
   - Import `AuthModalProvider` from `src/context/AuthModalContext.jsx`
   - Wrap your app root component
   - This enables context for all child components

2. **Create SignUpModal.jsx**
   - Use template from `AUTH_MODAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
   - Integrate your existing form validation
   - Connect to Firebase auth

3. **Create SignInModal.jsx**
   - Use template from `AUTH_MODAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
   - Integrate your existing signin logic
   - Connect to Firebase auth

4. **Update NavigationBar.jsx**
   - Replace auth Link components with button onClick handlers
   - Import and use `AuthModalContext`
   - Call `openSignUp()` and `openSignIn()`

5. **Update LandingPage.jsx**
   - Update navbar button handlers to use modals
   - Remove direct navigation to auth pages
   - Test the new flow

6. **Add Modals to App Root**
   - Render `<SignUpModal />` and `<SignInModal />` at app root
   - Make sure they're outside of main content
   - Should render at z-index 50 (modals)

### Optional (Nice to Have):

- Add smooth scroll animation in policy modal
- Add confetti animation on successful signup
- Add loading states with better feedback
- Add error messages for form validation
- Add rate limiting for signup attempts
- Add email verification step visual feedback
